## Overview
The FAQ Chatbot leverages state-of-the-art AI technologies to enhance user interaction and provide meaningful answers to user queries. The system incorporates:
- Generative AI for human-like responses.
- Semantic search to match user intent with the most relevant FAQ.
- A simple and interactive web interface for easy access.

The chatbot is particularly useful in domains where users seek quick, precise answers to repetitive questions, such as customer support, educational platforms, or organizational FAQs.

---

## Features
- **Human-like Responses**: Generates conversational replies using Hugging Face's GPT models.
- **Semantic Search**: Retrieves relevant answers based on query intent using Sentence Transformers and FAISS.
- **Real-time Interaction**: Offers a seamless user experience via a lightweight Streamlit-based UI.
- **Extensible Design**: Allows easy addition of new FAQs and integration with other models or APIs.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Generative AI**: Hugging Face’s GPT-2 and GPT-3 models for text generation.
- **Semantic Search**: Sentence Transformers and FAISS for embedding-based retrieval of relevant answers.
- **Front-end Interface**: Streamlit for building an interactive and responsive user interface.
- **Backend Logic**: Python for integrating models, processing queries, and handling semantic search.
- **Dataset**: FAQ data for training and testing the chatbot system.

## Project
  
## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/faq-chatbot.git
   cd faq-chatbot
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download Pre-trained Models**:
   Download the required Hugging Face models (e.g., GPT-2, Sentence Transformers) by running the script:
   ```bash
   python download_models.py
   ```

5. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   The application will be available at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Usage
1. Launch the application.
2. Enter your query in the input field.
3. The chatbot will process your query and provide a relevant, human-like response based on the FAQ dataset.

---

## System Workflow
1. **User Input**: The user enters a query through the Streamlit interface.
2. **Embedding Generation**: The query is converted into a semantic embedding using Sentence Transformers.
3. **Semantic Search**: FAISS retrieves the most relevant FAQ entry based on the embedding.
4. **Response Generation**: Hugging Face’s GPT-2/GPT-3 generates a conversational response.
5. **Output**: The chatbot displays the response in the UI.

---
## Future Enhancements
- **Advanced Context Handling**: Integrate transformers like BERT or GPT-4 for deeper context understanding.
- **Multi-language Support**: Enable support for FAQs in multiple languages.
- **Voice Input and Output**: Add speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities.
- **Dynamic FAQ Updates**: Provide an admin panel for adding or updating FAQs without modifying code.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Host the chatbot on platforms like AWS or GCP for scalability.
